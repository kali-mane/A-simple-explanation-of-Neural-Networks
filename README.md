A simple explanation of Neural Networks
        
**Machine Learning**
Machine Learning is a practice of using algorithms to analyze data, learn from that data and then make predictions about new data.
With machine learning, rather than manually writing code to accomplish a set of instructions, the machine is trained 
using lot of data and algorithms that gives the ability to perform the task without being explicitly being told how to do so.
    
    **Deep Learning**
    Deep Learning is a sub field of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of brain's neural networks. The
    algorithms and models in deep learning are based on the structure and function of the brain's neural networks and its learning occurs     either in supervised or unsupervised form.
